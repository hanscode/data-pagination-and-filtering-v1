### Project 2: Data Pagination and Filtering
Author - Hans Steffens

## Project Overview
Simple app that displays a list of any number of students that contains information such as name, email, and picture. The data is paginated so that the app loads the first nine students on the page  and allowing to the users to navigate between different pages of students. Also, the user will be able to filter the information by keyword.

## Features
- The number of pages and pagination buttons change based on how many search results are returned. For example, if 9 or fewer results are returned, 0 or 1 pagination buttons are displayed, if 22 search results are returned, 3 pagination buttons are displayed.
- When a search yields 0 results, a "No results" message is displayed on the page, and is removed or hidden when students are displayed on the page again.
- After a search, pages only display students that match the search criteria and pages display the correct number of students. For example, if 22 search results are returned, the third and final page should only display four students.
